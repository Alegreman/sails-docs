Get started by following the directions here: http://nodejs.org/\r\n\r\nOnce you have Node.js up and running, installing Sails is pretty dern easy.  Just type:\r\n```sh\r\nsudo npm install -g sails\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Creating a New Sails Project\r\n\r\nHere's how you get off the ground:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# Create the app\r\nsails new testProject\r\n\r\n# cd into the new project\r\ncd testProject\r\n\r\n# Fire up the server\t\r\n# (you have to run this from the root of your project)\r\nsails lift\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Creating a Model\r\nCreating a model is very easy with the command line tool. You can even define attributes and their\r\ntype by adding arguments at the end of the command. To generate a User model, enter the following:\r\n```\r\nsails generate model User\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will see that this creates a user model at **/api/models/User.js**.  Let's give her a name-- try uncommenting the name attribute so it looks more or less like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n        attributes      : {\r\n                name: 'STRING'\r\n        }\r\n\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n# What's Better Than Scaffolding?  How About a JSON API?\r\n\r\nSails API scaffolding is nothing like Rails scaffolding. HTML scaffolds just don't make sense for \r\nmodern web apps! Instead, Sails automatically builds a RESTful JSON API for your models. Best of\r\nall, it supports HTTP _and_ WebSockets! By default for every controller you create, you get the\r\nbasic CRUD operations created automatically.\r\n\r\nFor instance, after generating the User model above, if you visit `http://localhost:1337/user/create`, you'll see:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"createdAt\": \"2013-01-10T01:33:19.105Z\",\r\n  \"updatedAt\": \"2013-01-10T01:33:19.105Z\",\r\n  \"id\": 1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it!  You just created a model in the database!  You can also `find`, `update`, and `destroy` users:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# List of all users\r\nhttp://localhost:1337/user\r\n\r\n# Find the user with id 1\r\nhttp://localhost:1337/user/1\r\n\r\n# Create a new user\r\nhttp://localhost:1337/user/create\r\n(or send an HTTP POST to http://localhost:1337/user)\r\n\r\n# Update the user with id 1\r\nhttp://localhost:1337/user/update/1\r\n(or send an HTTP PUT to http://localhost:1337/user/1)\r\n\r\n# Destroy the user with id 1\r\nhttp://localhost:1337/user/destroy/1\r\n(or send an HTTP DELETE to http://localhost:1337/user/1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Security\r\nYou can control access to your application's endpoints using policies.  See: https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/wiki/Policies\r\n\r\n## Using https\r\nHTTPS works the same way in Sails as it does in Express.  Drop your certificate and key file into your project, then configure the path to them.  For example, if you put your cert and key in a directory called `ssl` in the root of your project, you'd want to add the following to your `config/application.js` file:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports.ssl = {\r\n  cert : fs.readFileSync(sails.config.appPath+'/ssl/combined.crt'),\r\n  key  : fs.readFileSync(sails.config.appPath+'/ssl/yoursite.com.key')\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Learn more\r\nhttps://github.com/balderdashy/sails/wiki/_pages\r\n\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n[![githalytics.com alpha](https://cruel-carlota.pagodabox.com/8acf2fc2ca0aca8a3018e355ad776ed7 \"githalytics.com\")](http://githalytics.com/balderdashy/sails/wiki/home)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
